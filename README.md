# Raw-Photo-File-Helper

I wrote this code to quickly create an input string for Lightroom to mass import RAW file types, based on a folder that held the same photos but in a viewable format such as ".JPG".

You first put the file type that will be scanned for  example a .JPG file, and then you input the file you want to change it to, for example .CR3. 

The program will then ask for a directory to acess the files from, then it will read the files and output a string that can be put into file explorer -- this lets you easily input your raw files into Adobe Lightroom.

This program runs the best using GoLang
